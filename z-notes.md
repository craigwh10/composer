-  How to handle conflicts that aren't shared between a single group.

   -  Not an issue as you can switch off and on the depencies that aren't needed.

-  What will it look like?
   -  Select deep nested file (any) and then depth of directories to search up from.
   -  Resulting yaml of shared shown (toggle into options)
   -  Services render at bottom with their app version etc.
   -  You will get a row with "shared dependencies" which you can turn off and on.
   -  Then the raw services without any conflicted dependencies will be able to be
      turned off an on as needed.
